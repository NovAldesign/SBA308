What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier? 
-Start with Psuedo code, I intial started trying to write the code based on what we had been asked to do, but I ended up removing the code and started back at square on writing the psuedo code to help me understand what I had and what I needed to accomplish.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
